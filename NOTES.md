# Responses To 3 Questions

## Briefly explain the design choices you made (e.g., DTOs, service structure) and why.
1. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
Choice: Use of ProductDTO.

Reason:
Decoupling: DTOs help decouple the data layer from the API layer. This allows for cleaner separation of concerns, making it easier to manage data validation and transformation.
Validation: DTOs are ideal for encapsulating input data, which can then be validated before being processed by the business logic.
Maintainability: Using DTOs improves code maintainability by providing a clear structure for the data being passed around, making it easier to modify data structures without affecting other layers.

2. Service Structure
Choice: Use of ProductService.

Reason:
Single Responsibility Principle: The service layer encapsulates business logic related to product management, keeping the controller focused solely on handling HTTP requests and responses.
Reusability: Services can be reused across different controllers or other services, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
Testability: Isolating business logic in services makes it easier to unit test the functionality without needing to deal with HTTP specifics or database interactions directly.


## What are the potential risks or drawbacks of the feature as specified in the requirements?
1. Performance Bottlenecks
Scalability Issues: The API may struggle to handle high traffic, leading to slow response times or downtime if not properly optimized and scaled.

2. Data Integrity Risks
Unique Constraints: The requirement for unique SKUs may result in conflicts, especially in a high-concurrency environment, potentially causing data integrity issues.

3. Security Vulnerabilities
API Exposure: Exposing APIs without proper authentication or rate limiting could open up the system to abuse, such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized access.

## How would you prepare this API for a high-traffic production environment?
1. Scalability
Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple server instances, ensuring no single server becomes a bottleneck.
Horizontal Scaling: Design the infrastructure to allow for easy horizontal scaling by adding more servers as demand increases.

2. Caching
Response Caching: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce the load on the database and speed up response times for frequently accessed data.

3. Testing and Staging Environments
Staging Environment: Maintain a staging environment that mirrors production for thorough testing before deploying updates.
Load Testing: Perform load testing to simulate high traffic and identify potential performance issues under stress.

6. Monitoring and Logging
Performance Monitoring: Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus to monitor performance metrics and identify bottlenecks.
Centralized Logging: Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack) to collect and analyze logs from different services, aiding in troubleshooting and performance analysis.
